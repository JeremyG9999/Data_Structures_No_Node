# 🧮 Data Structures Without Nodes

⚙️ This repository contains Python implementations of classic data structures that avoid using node pointers.  
Instead, built-in Python data types like lists and arrays are used for efficient and straightforward implementations.

## ✨ Features

- 📦 **Stack**  
  Using Python list to simulate LIFO behavior.  

- 📬 **Queue**  
  FIFO queue implemented without pointers.  

- 🔄 **Deque**  
  Double-ended queue without pointers.  

- 🧱 **Linked List**  
  Simulated linked list using lists, no explicit node class.  

- ⛏️ **Heap**  
  Min-heap or max-heap implementation using arrays.  

## 🚀 Getting Started
