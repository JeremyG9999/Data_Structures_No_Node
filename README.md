# Data Structures Without Nodes

This repository contains Python implementations of classic data structures that avoid using node pointers. Instead, built-in Python data types like lists and arrays are used for efficient and straightforward implementations.

## Features

- **Stack** – Using Python list to simulate LIFO behavior.
- **Queue** – FIFO queue implemented without pointers.
- **Deque** – Double-ended queue without pointers.
- **Linked List** – Simulated linked list using lists, no explicit node class.
- **Heap** – Min-heap or max-heap implementation using arrays.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeremyG9999/Data_Structures_No_Node.git
cd Data_Structures_No_Node
